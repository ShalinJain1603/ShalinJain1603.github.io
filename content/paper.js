vesti.innerHTML = `The project aims to build a recommender system for the website called Vesti.bg. As the company 
runs to serve its huge customer base (as clear from the given data!) completely and for their best interests. And
in order to do that it wants to recommend its users with articles that they should read next (based on mimicking
their reading pattern). This is expected to save a lot of its users’ time in thinking. Also, with better and
faster recommendations come people’s interest and that results in the company’s growth. The Company actually
has a huge customer base. So, providing them with what they might like can really help it in making good money.`;

onlineai.innerHTML = `In today’s Generation, Virtual Safety is equally important to physical safety. The whole world is 
digitalized and the young Generation plays a major role in this development. Thus, ensuring their safety 
should be a primary concern. AI and ML rule all the major and latest Tech Inventions. Be it Automated Vehicles, 
Online Shopping Websites, Search Engines, Image-Filters, everywhere. These can be used in this field as well and 
can make the Internet much safer for Kids.

Here I have developed a prototype that can help us solve this issue.
